## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **real-time object detection web application** built using **React.js** and **TensorFlow.js**, powered by the **COCO-SSD** pre-trained model. It allows your browser to access the webcam and detect multiple common objects live — all within the browser, without any server or cloud dependency.

Perfect for learning computer vision fundamentals, TensorFlow.js usage, or building your own browser-based ML tools.
